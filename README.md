Hello! 
This is a for-fun project that I made when I was a freshman in college in 2019 learning Python. When you run main.py using python, it will open a turtle screen. If you click on the screen, the terminal will prompt you to input a mass and a radius
to create a planetary object where you clicked. When you have created two or more objects, this script will simulate their motion as if they were planetary bodies in the vacuum of space (i.e their movement is entirely dependent on the force of Gravity between them).
When any two objects make contact with each other, the simulation will end and tell you that they have touched. I originally started making a simulator for a thrown ball, but decided later on to switch to planetary objects as I was beginning to get very interested in astrophysics at the time. Because of this, there are a few functions present in the project that currently do nothing.
Thanks for viewing!
